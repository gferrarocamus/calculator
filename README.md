>Basic calculator built with React

This calculator allows you to perform the four basic mathematical operations as well as percentage calculations. The operations are solved one at a time. It is possible to chain operations after getting a result.

This project was bootstrapped with [*Create React App*](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

See it [live on Heroku](https://math-magicians-inc-calculator.herokuapp.com/).
